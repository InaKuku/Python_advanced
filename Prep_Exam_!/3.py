# Create a function named flights that receives a different number of arguments representing the information about the flights for a day:
# the destination of each flight
# the count of passengers that are boarding the plane
# a string "Finish"
# You need to take each argument and make a dictionary with the planeâ€™s destination as a key and the passengers as a value of the corresponding key.
# If there are more than one flight to the same destination, you should count all the passengers that flew to the destination.
# You should modify the dictionary until the current argument is equal to "Finish".
# Note: Submit only the function in the judge system
# Input
# There will be no input, just parameters passed to your function
# Output
# The function should return the final dictionary
# Constrains
# All numbers will be valid integers in the range [0, 300]
# There will be no flight without given number of passengers
