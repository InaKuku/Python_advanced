# You are playing a game and your goal is to collect 100 coins.
#
# On the first line, you will be given a number representing the size of the field with square shape. On the next few lines, you will be given a field with:
# One player randomly placed in it and marked with symbol "P"
# Numbers for coins placed at different positions of the field
# Walls marked with "X".
# After the field state, you will be given commands for the players movement. Commands can be: "up", "down", "left", "right". If the command is invalid, you should ignore it.
# If the player goes out of the field or he hits a wall, he loses the game and his coins are reduced to 50% and rounded down to the next-lowest number. The program ends.
# Otherwise, the player has to collect at least 100 coins to win the game.
# For more clarifications see the examples below.
# Input
# Number representing the size of the field (matrix NxN)
# Matrix representing the field (each position separated by single space)
# On each of the next lines you will get a move command.
# Output
# If the player won the game, print: "You won! You've collected {total_coins} coins."
# If the player loses the game, print: "Game over! You've collected {total_coins} coins."
# Collected coins have to be rounded down to the next-lowest number.
# The field positions from which the player has collected coins as lists:
# "Your path:
# [{row_position1}{column_position1}]
# [{row_position2}{column_position2}]
# [{row_position3}{column_position3}]
# â€¦"
# Constrains
# There will be no case in which in the field will be less than 100 coins.
# All of the given numbers will be valid integers in the range [0, 100].
