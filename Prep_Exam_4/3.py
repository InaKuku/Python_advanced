# Maria is opening a cupcake shop. Help her manage her inventory to improve stock availability.
#
# Write a function called stock_availability which receives:
# an inventory list of boxes with different kinds of cupcake flavours
# "delivery" or "sell" as second parameter
# there might or might not be any other parameters â€“ numbers or strings at the end
#
# In case of "delivery"  to the shop was delivered new boxes with diferent kinds of cupcakes:
# You should add the boxes at the end of the inventory list
# There will be always at least one box delivered
# In case of "sell" Maria has a client and she is selling different boxes with cupcakes:
# If there is a number as another parameter, it means that Maria has sold that many boxes with cupcakes and you should remove them from the beginning of the inventory list
# If there is/are string/s as another parameter/s, it means that Maria has sold ALL cupcake boxes of the ordered flavour/s. Beware that not everything the buyer has ordered might be in stock, so you should check if the order is valid.
# If there are no other parameters, it means that Maria has sold only the first box of cupcakes and you should remove  it of the inventory list
# For more clarifications, see the examples below.
# Input
# There will be no input
# Parameters will be passed to your function
# Output
# The function should return a new inventory list
# All commands will be valid
